Fremote
==============

Fremote is a web app to remote-control YouTube & Vimeo videos.  A person can send a link to a friend they are chatting with on Skype and they can both watch the video/movie at the same time.  Whoever has control of the "remote" can start/pause/fast-forward/rewind the video and it will control the video for every viewer.

I am TDD/BDD'ing this app from the ground-up and I would like to avoid some of the pitfalls of a similar project of mine(Pass The Popcorn).  I will be using technologies such as MongoDB, HAML, and ActionController::Live.

Issues

Owner-only permissions currently don't work properly.

Needs more tests!

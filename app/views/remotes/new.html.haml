						We're changing the way that people watch & share videos.  
					%p Watching videos and movies has become a very isolated activity; let's it a social activity!

				%p
					With Fremote, you can share videos with people by creating a "remote" -- it will allow you to control your video for everyone watching it!  All you need to do is provide a link to the video you want to share; we currently support YouTube and Vimeo.  Support for many more video providers will come very soon.
				%p
					You can use our services without registering.  It's a great idea to register because it will not only give you a dedicated username for Fremote chat, but it will also allow you to make remotes that only you can control.

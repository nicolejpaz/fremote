Fremote

Fremote is a web app to remote-control YouTube & Vimeo videos.  A user can send a link to a friend(or friends) they are chatting with and they can watch the video/movie at the same time.  Whoever has control of the "remote" can start/pause/fast-forward/rewind the video and it will control the video for every viewer.

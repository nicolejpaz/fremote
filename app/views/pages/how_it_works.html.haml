    What's this "Fremote" thing?
  %p
    With Fremote, you can create a remote to take control of your online videos.  This remote will let you play/pause/scrub the video for whoever is watching.  It's a great way to watch videos together with friends over the net.  Your remote also lets you create a playlist and chat with watchers.  
  %p
    You can make remotes without registering, but an account gives you a dedicated chat handle and extra remote settings. 
  %p
    All you need to get started is a YouTube, Vimeo, Blip, Veoh, or Soundcloud link.
  %p
    Keep in mind that you must have a fast internet connection for a good Fremote experience.  We also suggest using a modern web browser that supports HTML5 video.  We like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Internet Explorer 10+.
